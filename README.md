=============

My friend Chip Taulbee's family is close. Seems like every year, he goes on at least one vacation with his parents and his three sibilings plus their spouses and children. They celebrate major holidays together. They're there for each other at all the major life events.

But more to the point: They love to ridicule one another. Each family member has his or her own catalogue of annoying personality traits, oft-repeated sayings and default behavior. And they each relish in catching one another in their most characteristic moments, when they can trot out their best impersonation. 

That's where the idea for Taulbee Bingo comes in. 

Start with a [compendium of character quirks](https://github.com/gordonje/taulbee_bingo/blob/master/tiles.txt "Tile List"). Then use that list to generate five-by-five grids--the bingo card--of [randomly selected](https://github.com/gordonje/taulbee_bingo/blob/master/script.js#L27) possibilities one might expect at a typical Taulbee gathering. Each player can load his or her own card in a browser (looks great on a tablet, not so much on a phone) and keep track of the good times.

As per traditional bingo rules, the middle square is a "gimme", [the same for every card](https://github.com/gordonje/taulbee_bingo/blob/master/script.js#L25). Apparently Sam farts are pretty frequent (might want to see a doctor about that).
